<h2> My Favorite Hobbies</h2>
<p> Some of my favorite things to do when I have some free time are playing basketball with my friends or anything basketball related, listening to music, and editing. Basketball is one of my favorite things to do because I can do it for hours and still have fun doing it even if I'm extremely sweaty, I'll continue to play. I especially think basketball is one of my more important hobbies in the sense that it promotes teamwork and cohesiveness. If I'm not physically playing basketball then I'll hop on 2K18. Besides basketball I'll usually be listening to music. My musical taste has a some range, during middle school I was very into hardcore and metal music; I still listen to some of my favorite bands like Bring Me The Horizon and Dance Gavin Dance occassionally but at the moment I'm into Lil Peep so that's what I listen to nowadays. Apart from listening to music or anything basketball related, I like to edit. I usually edit anime I like and post them on Instagram, but recently I haven't had much time because of school and AP Exams. I find editing extremely fun because you can create your own version of something that already exists. For example, I'm working on an edit as of 5/27/18 and it's of a basketball clip (where Jayson Tatum does the smitty on Ben Simmons) and I'm adding my own music and effects to it which makes it unique and different from what it originally was.  </p>
